Hi, I’m Nasib!

I’m passionate about solving challenging problems to build the kind of world we dreamed about as kids. I studied Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, but slowly but surely drifted to machine learning. My journey has taken me from building autonomous drones showcased to NATO to applying Large Language Models in the pharmaceutical industry.

I’ve worked on fascinating research projects, from neural compression and [adversarial attacks in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06761) to reinforcement learning and [3D vision](https://github.com/nanaimi/HoleDet). Along the way, I co-founded ([DroGone](http://drogone.com)), an autonomous counter-drone system, collaborating with some incredibly talented friends.

At [Reliant AI](https://reliant.ai), I work on improving model reliability in sensitive domains by tackling challenges like hallucinations in Large Language Models.

If you’re working on something exciting or want to chat, please reach out :\)\)
