Hi, I’m Nasib!

I’m passionate about solving challenging problems to build the kind of world we dreamed about as kids. I studied Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, but like many others, I gravitated toward machine learning. My journey so far has taken me from building autonomous drones showcased to NATO to applying Large Language Models in the pharmaceutical industry.

I’ve had the chance to work on fascinating research projects, from neural compression and [adversarial attacks in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06761) to reinforcement learning and [3D vision](https://github.com/nanaimi/HoleDet). Along the way, I co-founded ([DroGone](http://drogone.com)), an autonomous counter-drone system, collaborating with some incredibly talented friends.

Currently, I’m part of [Reliant AI](https://reliant.ai), where my focus is on improving model reliability in sensitive domains by tackling challenges like hallucinations in Large Language Models.

If you’re working on something exciting or just want to chat, please reach out :\)\)
