Hi there, welcome to my site. I am a student at ETH Zurich specializing in signal processing and machine learning. I have worked on projects in autonomous robotics ([DroGone](http://drogone.com)) at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/), [adversarial attacks in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06761), reinforcement learning, [3D vision](https://github.com/nanaimi/HoleDet), and neural compression at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/). Feel free to connect with me on any of the topics or projects I have worked on. Thoughts and opinions shared on this website are my own.

I am currently working at Reliant AI, aiming to deliver reliable Large Language Models to the Pharmaceutical Industry. My interests currently lie in representation learning, self-supervised learning, and compression.

Hi, I’m Nasib!

I’m passionate about solving challenging problems to build the kind of world we dreamed about as kids. I studied Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, but like many others, I gravitated toward machine learning. My journey so far has taken me from building autonomous drones showcased to NATO to applying Large Language Models in the pharmaceutical industry.

I’ve had the chance to work on fascinating research projects, from neural compression and [adversarial attacks in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06761) to reinforcement learning and [3D vision](https://github.com/nanaimi/HoleDet). Along the way, I co-founded ([DroGone](http://drogone.com)), an autonomous counter-drone system, collaborating with some incredibly talented friends.

Currently, I’m part of [Reliant AI](https://reliant.ai), where my focus is on improving model reliability in sensitive domains by tackling challenges like hallucinations in Large Language Models.

If you’re working on something exciting or just want to chat, please reach out :\)\)
