Hi there, welcome to my site. I am a student at ETH Zurich specializing in signal processing and machine learning. I have worked on projects in autonomous robotics ([DroGone](http://drogone.com)) at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/), [adversarial attacks in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06761), reinforcement learning, and [3D vision](https://github.com/nanaimi/HoleDet). Feel free to connect with me on any of the topics or projects I have worked on. Thoughts and opinions shared on this website are my own.

I am currently doing my Master's Thesis at the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich on the topic of implicit neural representations for compression. My interests currently lie in representation learning, self-supervised learning, and compression.
