Hi there, welcome to my site. I am a student at ETH Zurich specializing in signal processing and machine learning. I have worked on projects in autonomous robotics ([DroGone](http://drogone.com)) at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/), adversarial attacks in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and 3D vision. Feel free to connect with me on any of the topics or projects I have worked on. Thoughts and opinions shared on this website are my own.

Quality memes always appreciated.
