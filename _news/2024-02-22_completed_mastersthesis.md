I successfully completed my Master's Thesis on Implicit Neural Representations for Compression using Multi-Resolution Hash Encodings and Conditioned Entropy Regularization. A big thank you to my Supervisors Janis Postels and Yannick Str√ºmpler for the support during the project and valuable conversations. My thesis was supervised by Prof. Luc van Gool of the <a href="https://vision.ee.ethz.ch">Computer Vision Lab</a> and Dr. Federico Tombari, Research Scientist at Google.
