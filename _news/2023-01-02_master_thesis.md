I have written a proposal for my master thesis on compression for attribute obfuscation. I hope to build on the work of Dubois et al. on  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10800">_Lossy Compression for Lossless Prediction_</a> to develop general purpose compressors that produce privacy enabling representations for downstream tasks, with minimal impact on performance. 

Read the proposal [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/MT_proposal.pdf). Feel free to reach out with comments/advice/insights.
