Excited to say that I have begun my Master's Thesis on Implicit Neural Representations for Compressions at the <a href="https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/">Computer Vision Lab</a>. headed by Prof. Luc Van Gool. Looking forward to working with Janis Postels and Yannic Str√ºmpler to find novel ways of compressing information with implicit neural representations.
