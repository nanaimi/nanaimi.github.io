Who would have thought that we would actually win a prize? Not us, but it still happened. 

We secured a bag at Junction 2022, Europe's largest hackathon with 1300 participants. Our AI powered indicators to enhance alogirithmic trading of crypto received 2nd prize in the Crypto Trading Helper challenge posed by <a href="https://www.gravityteam.co">Gravity Team</a>. Our indicators used sentiment of crypto on twitter, volumes of tweets, and the klines of the cryptocurrency to predict whether price, volume, or volitility would rise or fall. What did we learn? We can do so fairly well for volatility and scraping reddit or twitter is absolutely painful. Our prize? 0.5 ETH which has already lost 25% of its value, let's gooo!
