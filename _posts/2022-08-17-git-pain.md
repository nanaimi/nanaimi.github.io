# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
toc:
  - name: EqRebase or Merge?
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:

    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
  - name: .gitignore

# Below is an example of injecting additional post-specific styles.
# If you use this post as a template, delete this _styles block.
