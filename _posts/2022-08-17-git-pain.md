# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
toc:
  - name: Rebase or Merge?
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
  - name: .gitignore
  - name: Removing last commit and rewriting history (careful!)

# Below is an example of injecting additional post-specific styles.
# If you use this post as a template, delete this _styles block.

## Rebase or Merge?

## .gitignore

[setup a gitignore file](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)

## Removing last commit and rewriting history (careful!)

Use the reset command. First undo the local commit 

{% highlight bash %} git reset HEAD^ {% endhighlight %}

Then, force push the reverted local commit to the remote git repository with

{% highlight bash %} git push origin +HEAD {% endhighlight %}

**Note:** This will overwrite the commits that you reverted and they will no longer exist.

## revert unstaged changes
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52704/how-do-i-discard-unstaged-changes-in-git">source</a>

For all unstaged files in current working directory use:

{% highlight bash %}
git restore .
{% endhighlight %}

For a specific file use:

{% highlight bash %}
git restore path/to/file/to/revert
{% endhighlight %}

That together with git switch replaces the overloaded git checkout, and thus removes the argument disambiguation.

If a file has both staged and unstaged changes, only the unstaged changes shown in git diff are reverted. Changes shown in git diff --staged stay intact.


# git diff a file between commits
From the git-diff manpage:

git diff [--options] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>...]
For instance, to see the difference for a file "main.c" between now and two commits back, here are three equivalent commands:

$ git diff HEAD^^ HEAD main.c
$ git diff HEAD^^..HEAD -- main.c
$ git diff HEAD~2 HEAD -- main.c
