Carbonara is the dish with which every italian will try and pick up a girl. The key to perfect carbonara lies in the technique, particularly in managing the heat when combining the eggs with the pasta to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound (450g) spaghetti
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup (100g) freshly grated Pecorino Romano
- Parmeggiano Reggiano to taste (optional)
- Fresh ground black pepper (a generous amount)
- 8 oz (225g) guanciale or bacon, diced
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Egg Mixture:**
   - Separate the egg whites and yolks into a bowl
   - Mix in the grated Pecorino Romano
   - Add a hefty amount of freshly ground black pepper
   - If desired, add some grated Parmeggiano Reggiano to taste
   - Mix well and set aside

2. **Cook the Guanciale/Bacon:**
   - Cook the diced guanciale or bacon in a large frying pan until crispy
   - VERY IMPORTANT: Once cooked, separate into two components:
     - Transfer the crispy meat to a bowl
     - Pour the rendered fat into a separate bowl
   - Keep the frying pan aside with a light coating of the rendered fat

3. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to boil
   - Cook the spaghetti slightly more al dente than usual, as it will finish cooking in the pan
   - Reserve some pasta cooking water before draining

4. **The Critical Assembly:**
   - Place the reserved frying pan over medium heat
   - Transfer the cooked pasta to the frying pan with some rendered fat
   - Lower the heat to medium-low
   - Slowly mix in the egg mixture while continuously tossing the pasta
   - Add a bit more rendered fat as needed
   - IMPORTANT: Keep the heat low to prevent scrambling the eggs
   - Add 1-2 tablespoons of reserved pasta water to achieve desired consistency
   - Mix in the crispy guanciale/bacon

5. **Serve:**
   - Plate immediately while the sauce is hot and creamy
   - Optionally top with additional grated cheese and black pepper

## Tips

- Temperature control is crucial: the pan should be warm enough to create a creamy sauce but not so hot that it scrambles the eggs
- Using room temperature eggs helps create a smoother sauce
- Traditional Roman carbonara uses guanciale.
- Don't skip separating the meat from its rendered fat, you want the guanciale to remain crispy until served.
- Use bucatini if you can.


## Is it actually called "Spaghetti Breakfast"?

With eggs and bacon as key ingredients, this pasta dish makes for a surprisingly perfect breakfast option might say. If you really want to bother a roman, tell them carbonara was invented by american soldiers in italy mid-century and is actually called ["spaghetti breakfast"](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230331-carbonara-the-iconic-pasta-causing-a-dispute#:~:text=Cozzella%20interviewed%20the,from%20the%20British.).
