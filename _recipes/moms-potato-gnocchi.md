These traditional Italian potato gnocchi are light and fluffy. The key to perfect gnocchi lies in using the right potatoes and handling the dough well.

## Ingredients

- 1 kg floury/starchy potatoes
- 300g all-purpose flour
- 1-2 eggs
- Salt (a small amount)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Potatoes:**
   - Steam the potatoes until very tender
   - Pass them through a potato ricer or mash very finely
   - Let cool completely
   - Note: Cooling is crucial for the right texture

2. **Make Dough:**
   - Once potatoes are completely cool, add the flour
   - Add 1-2 eggs
   - Add a small amount of salt
   - Gently mix everything together
   - IMPORTANT: Do not overwork the dough

3. **Form Gnocchi:**
   - Roll the dough into long ropes (about the thickness of your thumb)
   - Cut into small pieces (about 2-3 cm long)
   - Create ridges by rolling each piece on a fork (passarli con la forchetta) (I suck at this)
   - Place on a lightly floured surface while working

4. **Cook Gnocchi:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to boil
   - Cook gnocchi in batches (don't overcrowd)
   - They're done when they float to the surface (usually 2-3 minutes)
   - Remove with a slotted spoon

## Tips for Perfect Gnocchi

- Potato Selection:
  - Use floury/starchy potatoes (like Russet or Yukon Gold)
  - Avoid waxy potatoes as they'll make heavy gnocchi

- Cooking Potatoes:
  - Steam rather than boil if possible
  - If boiling, keep the skin on to prevent waterlogging
  - Drain well and let them steam dry

- Dough Making:
  - Let potatoes cool completely before adding other ingredients
  - Don't overwork the dough or gnocchi will become tough
  - If dough is too sticky, add flour gradually
  - Work quickly but gently

## Serving Suggestions

- Classic: Toss with butter and sage
- Simple: Drizzle with olive oil and add grated Parmigiano. Maybe some truffle oil
- Tomato: Serve with your favorite tomato sauce
- Pesto: Toss with fresh basil pesto

## Storage

Uncooked gnocchi can be:
- Refrigerated: Up to 24 hours (place on tray, cover with cloth)
- Frozen:
  - Place on a floured tray, not touching
  - Freeze until solid (about 2-3 hours)
  - Transfer to freezer bag
  - Store up to 2 months
  - Cook directly from frozen (they'll take slightly longer)
