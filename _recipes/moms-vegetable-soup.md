There is nothing like a good vegetable soup when you are ill or just want to warm up. Get good ingredients, get better soup.

## Ingredients

- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 medium potatoes, chopped
- 1-2 carrots, chopped
- 1/4 celery root (or 2-3 celery stalks), chopped
- 2-3 medium zucchini, chopped (optional)
- 1 head of broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 bouillon cube
- Fresh parsley
- Olive oil for sautéing
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Water (enough to cover vegetables)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Base (Soffritto):**
   - Heat olive oil in a large pot
   - Sauté the chopped onion until translucent (soffriggere una cipolla)

2. **Add Root Vegetables:**
   - Add the chopped potatoes, carrots, and celery
   - Sauté briefly with the onions. Do not over saute the onions, will not taste good.
   - Add enough water to just cover the vegetables (non troppa acqua)

3. **Complete the Soup:**
   - Add the chopped zucchini and broccoli
   - Add the bouillon cube (dado)
   - Add fresh parsley
   - Cook for about 20 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender

4. **Finish:**
   - Once everything is cooked, blend the soup until smooth
   - Adjust seasoning to taste

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve hot with:
  - A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
  - Freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano, or some pieces of Parmigiano Reggiano
  - Fresh parsley
  - Fresh ground black pepper
  - Crusty bread
- Can be served with homemade gnocchi for a more substantial meal

## Tips

- Don't add too much water - you want the vegetables just covered
- The consistency can be adjusted after blending by adding more hot water if needed
- The bouillon cube adds enough salt, so taste before adding more
- Feel free to adjust the vegetables based on what's in season or available
- For a smoother soup, blend longer
- For a thinner consistency, add hot water after blending

## Storage

- The soup can be refrigerated for up to 3-4 days
- Can be frozen for up to 3 months
- When reheating, you may need to add a little water to adjust consistency
