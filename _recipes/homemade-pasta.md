Homemade pasta is simple but takes time. If somebody makes this for you, you clearly mean something to them. The ratio of 100g flour per egg makes it easy to scale the recipe to your needs.

## Ingredients

Basic ratio per serving (scale up as needed):
- 100g flour (tipo 00 if available, all-purpose works too)
- 1 large egg
- A drizzle of olive oil (or truffle oil for something special)
- Pinch of salt

For example, for 3 servings:
- 300g flour
- 3 eggs
- 1-2 tsp olive oil/truffle oil
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Flour:**
   - Sift the flour through a fine-mesh sieve
   - Form the flour into a mound on a clean work surface
   - Create a well in the center (like a volcano)
   - Make sure the well is wide enough to hold the eggs

2. **Add the Eggs:**
   - Crack the eggs into the well
   - Add your choice of oil
   - Add a pinch of salt
   - Using a fork, gradually beat the eggs, incorporating a little flour from the inner edges of the well
   - Keep mixing, gradually incorporating more flour while maintaining the well shape
   - Continue until the mixture becomes too thick for the fork

3. **Form the Dough:**
   - Use your hands to gradually incorporate the remaining flour
   - Knead the dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes)
   - The dough should be firm but pliable
   - If too sticky, add flour a little at a time
   - If too dry, wet your hands slightly and continue kneading

4. **Rest the Dough:**
   - Form the dough into a ball
   - Wrap tightly in plastic wrap (cling film)
   - Let rest in a dark place for at least 30 minutes
   - Can rest up to 2 hours at room temperature

## Rolling and Cutting

By Hand (Wine Bottle Method):
- Generously flour your work surface
- Use a wine bottle as a rolling pin (clean and dry!)
- Roll dough until very thin, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking
- You should be able to see your hand through the dough when it's thin enough
- Gently fold the sheet of dough over itself a few times (like folding a letter)
- Using a sharp knife, cut into strips of your desired width
- Unfold the strips and dust with flour to prevent sticking

With Pasta Machine:
- Start with widest setting
- Pass through multiple times, folding in thirds between passes
- Gradually decrease width setting
- Use plenty of flour to prevent sticking
- Cut using machine attachment or by hand
- If cutting by hand, fold the sheet gently and slice to desired width

## Cooking

- Bring a large pot of salted water to boil
- Fresh pasta cooks VERY quickly (1-2 minutes only!)
- Test for doneness - should be al dente
- Reserve some pasta water before draining
- Don't overcook - fresh pasta becomes mushy quickly

## Tips

- Room temperature eggs work best
- Don't skip the resting time - it allows the gluten to relax
- The dough should be smooth and silky, not sticky or crumbly
- If using truffle oil, use less than you would olive oil - it's potent
- Flour is your friend - use plenty when rolling and cutting
- The wine bottle trick works surprisingly well - just make sure it's clean and dry
- If the dough springs back while rolling, let it rest for 5 minutes and try again

## Variations

- Add finely chopped herbs to the dough
- Use semolina flour for part of the flour amount
- Add a pinch of saffron to the eggs for golden pasta
- Replace some eggs with egg yolks for richer pasta

## Storage

Fresh pasta can be:
- Used immediately
- Dried on a rack (12-24 hours)
- Refrigerated up to 2 days
- Frozen up to 2 weeks (freeze on tray first, then bag)

## Note

The 100g flour per egg ratio is foolproof, making it easy to make exactly how much you need. Whether you're making pasta for one or for a crowd, just remember: one egg, 100g flour, and a bit of patience!
